## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: UTC offset on location rows
Every location row in the Cards view SHALL show the location's UTC offset on its secondary line, after the country name. The offset MUST be derived from the location's canonical IANA identifier for the current instant, so daylight saving time is respected; a raw offset MUST NOT be stored or used to identify a location. The offset MUST be computed when the list is presented (the app opens, a location is added or removed, the list changes in another tab, the interface language changes) and MUST NOT be refreshed on a timer while the page stays open. Inputs: the location's IANA identifier, the current instant (ISO 8601 with `Z`), the interface language. Output: the offset text. Errors: when the offset cannot be computed for the identifier, the row MUST be shown without the offset and the rest of the list MUST be unaffected. The offset needs no network and behaves the same offline. <!-- implements FR1, FR2, FR4, FR6, UX1 of show-utc-offset-on-location-rows -->

#### Scenario: Whole-hour zone
- **GIVEN** the current instant is `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **AND** the list contains Moscow (`Europe/Moscow`)
- **WHEN** the user opens the app
- **THEN** the Moscow row shows `UTC+3`

#### Scenario: Half-hour zone
- **GIVEN** the current instant is `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **AND** the list contains Kolkata (`Asia/Kolkata`)
- **WHEN** the user opens the app
- **THEN** the Kolkata row shows `UTC+5:30`

#### Scenario: 45-minute zone
- **GIVEN** the current instant is `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **AND** the list contains Kathmandu (`Asia/Kathmandu`)
- **WHEN** the user opens the app
- **THEN** the Kathmandu row shows `UTC+5:45`

#### Scenario: Daylight saving time is respected
- **GIVEN** the list contains New York (`America/New_York`)
- **WHEN** the user opens the app at `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **THEN** the New York row shows `UTC−4`
- **WHEN** the user opens the app at `2026-01-15T12:00:00Z`
- **THEN** the New York row shows `UTC−5`

#### Scenario: Zero offset
- **GIVEN** the current instant is `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **AND** the list contains UTC (`UTC`)
- **WHEN** the user opens the app
- **THEN** the UTC row shows `UTC`

#### Scenario: Offset is computed again when the list changes
- **GIVEN** the list contains New York (`America/New_York`)
- **AND** the app was opened at `2026-01-15T12:00:00Z`, so the New York row shows `UTC−5`
- **WHEN** the current instant is `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **AND** the user adds Kolkata
- **THEN** the New York row shows `UTC−4`
- **AND** the Kolkata row shows `UTC+5:30`

#### Scenario: Offset that cannot be computed
- **GIVEN** the list holds Moscow and a location whose zone the browser does not know (for example `Mars/Olympus_Mons`)
- **WHEN** the list is presented
- **THEN** that location's row shows its city and remove action without an offset
- **AND** the Moscow row shows `UTC+3`

### Requirement: UTC offset text
The offset text SHALL be the localized prefix followed by a sign and the whole hours, followed by `:` and the minutes as two digits only when the minutes are not zero. A positive offset MUST use `+`; a negative offset MUST use the minus sign U+2212 (`−`), never the hyphen-minus (`-`). A zero offset MUST be the prefix alone. The prefix MUST come from the locale files and exist in English and Russian (`UTC` in both). <!-- implements FR3, FR5, UX2 of show-utc-offset-on-location-rows -->

#### Scenario: Offsets are written in one form
- **WHEN** offsets of +3:00, +5:30, +5:45, −4:00, −5:30 and 0:00 are shown
- **THEN** they read `UTC+3`, `UTC+5:30`, `UTC+5:45`, `UTC−4`, `UTC−5:30` and `UTC`

#### Scenario: Negative offset uses the minus sign
- **WHEN** an offset of −5:00 is shown
- **THEN** its text contains U+2212 and no hyphen-minus

#### Scenario: Russian interface
- **GIVEN** the interface language is Russian
- **AND** the current instant is `2026-07-15T12:00:00Z`
- **AND** the list contains Moscow
- **WHEN** the user opens the app
- **THEN** the Moscow row shows the Russian locale's prefix followed by `+3`

### Requirement: Offsets are fast, accessible and fit every screen
Presenting 50 locations with their offsets SHALL take at most 50 ms, and the offset MUST appear in the same render as its row, with no loading state. The list with offsets MUST have no axe-core violations in the light and dark themes. A list whose offsets include `UTC+5:30`, `UTC+5:45` and a negative offset MUST NOT scroll horizontally at 320 px and 2560 px, and the approved "list" screenshots at 375 px and 1024 px in both themes MUST show the offsets. <!-- implements NFR-P1, NFR-A1, NFR-R1, NFR-R2 of show-utc-offset-on-location-rows -->

#### Scenario: 50 rows within the budget
- **GIVEN** 50 locations
- **WHEN** their rows are presented with offsets
- **THEN** it takes at most 50 ms

#### Scenario: No accessibility violations with offsets
- **GIVEN** the list contains locations with offsets
- **WHEN** the list is shown in the light or the dark theme
- **THEN** axe-core reports no violations

#### Scenario: Offsets fit narrow and wide screens
- **GIVEN** the list is Kolkata, Kathmandu and New York
- **WHEN** the list is shown at 320 px or 2560 px
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally
